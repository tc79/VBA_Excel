### FixBalanceSheet
The Balance Sheet that Simple Accounting exports to Excel has the subtotals and section totals on the separate column next to the column where the values are. Some people may want to have it at the same column. This macro finds the cells that should have subtotals and the totals for each section of the Balance Sheet, recalculate these subtotals and totals, and clear the column next to the values.
